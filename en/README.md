1. ## Winning

   Most games have a _goal_: some way of winning and, usually, seeing a _"You Win!"_ message on the screen. Without a _goal_, a _player_ doesn't know when they're done and they never have the fun of knowing they've beaten the game.

   For example, in platform games \(like **Mario** or **Rayman**\) your _goal_ is to reach the end of the stage. In other games your _goal_ might be to collect the most points before time runs out, or before you lose all your health.

   There are a few games with no clear built-in _goals_, like some versions of **Minecraft**. They instead offer a world where the _player_ can explore and decide their own goals. These games are harder to build and harder to make fun for the _player_.

   > ### Start planning your game!
   >
   > Have you decided on a _game_ you want to make? Then take a piece of paper \(or a file on your computer\) and write down the answers to these questions:
   >
   > * Does your game have a _"You Win!"_ screen?
   > * How does a _player_ reach that _"You Win!"_ screen?
   > * Is the _goal_ of the game easy for the _player_ to learn and understand?
   > * Does the _player_ know what they need to do to reach the _goal_?

2. ## Losing

   Most games also have a _"You Lose"_ screen, when the _player_ loses all their  health or fails to complete the _goal_. It might also be a _"Game Over"_ or _"Timeâ€™s up"_ screen depending on how you've decided your game works. Without a way of losing there is no risk for the _player_, no uncertainty in completing the _goal_.

   Decide what _resources_, like health, magic power, tools or fuel, that the _player_ can use to complete the _goal_. A very easy way to add a losing condition is by adding a _time limit_.

   Other _"You Lose"_ screens could be events: When the _player's_ _character_ falls down a pit, or when a customer in the _player's_ restaurant loses her patience while waiting for her dish.

   In most games, if you start the game and do nothing, you eventually lose. This pushes the _player_ forward and encourages them to do something, adding excitement.

   Also, you should decide how long a game will be. If a _stage_ or _level_ takes two hours to complete, it might be too long for a simple platform game. Be careful though: The _player_ might not feel they've succeeded in anything if it only takes a couple of minutes to complete.

   > ### Update your plan!
   >
   > Get your plan out again and note down the answers to these questions:
   >
   > * What can cause the _player_ to lose the game?
   > * What can the _player_ do to avoid losing?
   > * What is the ideal game length, if the _player_ plays well?
